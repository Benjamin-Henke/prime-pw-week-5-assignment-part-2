[] Completed Assignment
  [x] Place the existing `h1` inside a `header` element.
  [x] Add an `h2` element into the `header` that says `YOUR NAME's Record Shop`.
  [x] Place the existing `p` inside a `main` element.

  [x] Create a `stylesheet.css` file and source it into the HTML file.
  [x] Give the `header` a dark background color and choose a light  color for the text.
  [x] Center the text in the `header`.
  [x] Give the `main` a light grey background color.
  [x] Look up the CSS `background-image` property to learn how to use the provided `record.png` as the background image on your page with a relative path.
  [] Look up CSS `background-repeat` to learn how to fill the body of the page with a repeating image.
  [] Look up CSS `margin` and `padding`.
    [x] Give the `body` a margin of `0`. (This removes the whitespace around the edges of the page.)
    [x] Give the `main` padding of `1em`. (Curious about `em`? Look up CSS units.)

__ STRETCH GOAL __
 [x] Use CSS style classes vs element names to do your styling, except for adding the margin to the `body`. That is a good thing to add to every CSS file, and it should use the `body` HTML tag name.
